# esp32c6-sniffer

This POC (Proof of concept) tool showcases an ESP32C6 with the ESP-IDF framework, to be a WiFi sniffer with the capabilities of looking for user-specified settings.

Originally, this was meant to be firmware for the M5NanoC6, but it is likely that this can compile on other ESP32 boards.

**As a developer, I do not endorse the illegal use of this firmware. Any sort of trouble you get into I am not responsible for!!!**
